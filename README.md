# PCI-passthrough-ez-bash-scripts-
 Gaming In linux  for some reason in becoming a thing.  <br>
 but its still difficult to play some games directlly on linux but ez and secure to play inside a qemu vm < br>
 this scripts are for ez automation of getting pci-passthrough without know any of the details < br>
 
  
 ## Useful for security
 Enabling pci passthrough is a great security defect (personal belief) . if you are using vms for other reasons rether gaming < br>
 These scripts are mainly maid to quicklly enable/disable  pci -passthrough so that  <br>
 you dont have to enable pci-passthrough for ever just for gaming
